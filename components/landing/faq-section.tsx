    question: "What is a bonding curve?",
    answer:
      "A bonding curve is a mathematical formula that determines token price based on supply. As more tokens are bought, the price increases automatically, ensuring fair price discovery.",
  },
  {
    question: "How much does it cost to launch a token?",
    answer:
      "Token creation requires a small fee to cover Solana network costs and deployment. The exact amount varies based on network conditions.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens when my token graduates?",
    answer:
      "When your token reaches the market cap target, liquidity automatically migrates to a Meteora DLMM pool, providing deeper liquidity and better trading experience.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I add liquidity after launch?",
    answer:
      "The bonding curve automatically manages liquidity during the initial phase. After graduation, you can add liquidity to the Meteora pool like any other DEX.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is there a token listing fee?",
    answer:
      "No, there are no listing fees. You only pay for the initial token creation and Solana network transaction fees.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I promote my token?",
    answer:
      "You can add social links during token creation. Share your token page, engage with the community, and let the fair launch mechanism do the rest.",
  },
